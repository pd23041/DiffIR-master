#### News
- **Dec 19, 2023:**  We propose reference-based DiffIR (DiffRIR) to alleviate texture, brightness, and contrast disparities between generated and preserved regions during image editing, such as inpainting and outpainting. All training and inference codes and pre-trained models (x1, x2, x4) are released at [Github](https://github.com/Zj-BinXia/DiffRIR)
- **Sep 10, 2023:** For real-world SR, we release x1 and x2 pre-trained models.
- **Sep 6, 2023:** For real-world SR and SRGAN, we can test [LR images without GT images](DiffIR-RealSR/options/test_DiffIRS2_GAN_x4.yml) and [inference](DiffIR-RealSR/inference_diffir.py). 
- **August 31, 2023:** For real-world SR and SRGAN tasks, we updated 2x SR training files. 
- **August 28, 2023:** For real-world SR tasks, we released the pretrained models [RealworldSR-DiffIRS2-GANV2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H4DU-9fB15fSz-OFko00HlWYbNSqmAKq?usp=sharing) and [training files](DiffIR-RealSR/options/train_DiffIRS2_GAN_x4_V2.yml) that are more focused on perception rather than the distortionï¼Œ which can be used to super-resolve AIGC generated images. 
- **July 20, 2023:** Training&Testing codes and pre-trained models are released!

> **Abstract:** *Diffusion model (DM) has achieved SOTA performance by modeling the image synthesis process into a sequential application of a denoising network. However, different from image synthesis, image restoration (IR) has a strong constraint to generate results in accordance with ground-truth. Thus, for IR, traditional DMs running massive iterations on a large model to estimate whole images or feature maps is inefficient. To address this issue, we propose an efficient DM for IR (DiffIR), which consists of a compact IR prior extraction network (CPEN), dynamic IR transformer (DIRformer), and denoising network. Specifically, DiffIR has two training stages: pretraining and training DM. In pretraining, we input ground-truth images into CPEN$_{S1}$ to capture a compact IR prior representation (IPR) to guide DIRformer. In the second stage, we train the DM to directly estimate the same IRP as pretrained CPEN$_{S1}$ only using LQ images. We observe that since the IPR is only a compact vector,  DiffIR can use fewer iterations than traditional DM to obtain accurate estimations and generate more stable and realistic results. Since the iterations are few, our DiffIR can adopt a joint optimization of CPEN$_{S2}$, DIRformer, and denoising network, which can further reduce the estimation error influence. We conduct extensive experiments on several IR tasks and achieve SOTA performance while consuming less computational costs.*
